# Flow-Plateform
Medical research in the modern era is increasingly data-driven, and improved analytical methods are needed to allow researchers to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. Flow cytometry is a powerful method for analysis of cell populations, and is widely used in immunology, cancer biology, and drug discovery. Better flow cytometry data analysis will accelerate precision diagnosis, personalized medicine and even revolutionise clinical drug trials across multiple centres.

This project aims to develop an web-hosted platform for the exploration and analysis of high-dimensional, flow cytometry data. The platform will provide researchers with tools to visualize, analyze, and derive insights from this rich and complex data source.
